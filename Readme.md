# IEEE Fraud detection competition

This code contains code for the completion currently held at Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection) 


The goal of this project is two-fold: to feel the sense of Kaggle competitions,
and sharpen my skills in data science on the real-world data set.

My primary task here would be to write as clean code as possible and use the
best practices of data science.

I am working on this project in my free time, so updates can be irregular.
